# Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do those `docs` files appearing in my PR come from?

The `docs` folder contains the live documentation generated by [docz](https://docz.site/) and accessible at https://dashlane.github.io/ui-components/ using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Since we don't have any CI for this repository yet, a post-commit hook will check if any `.mdx` file has changed, and eventually build the docz documentation and create a new commit. This way the live documentation is always up to date.
